# What is my User Agent?

Shows a page containing the User Agent string of the client that performed the request.

This is a very simple project I built to test my production server.

To use:
- Clone this repository
- Run "npm install" to install the dependencies
- **Important**: by default runs on port 3000, you can customize the port number in package.json

Usage:
- `npm run dev`: runs the server on port 3000
- `npm run production`: runs the server on port 3000 while passing NODE_ENV=production
